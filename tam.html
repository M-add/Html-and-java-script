	  <p>
	  Tamil Nadu (/ˌtæmɪl ˈnɑːduː/; Tamil: [ˈtamiɻ ˈnaːɽɯ] (listen), abbr. TN) is a state in southern India. The tenth largest Indian state by area and the sixth largest by population, Tamil Nadu is the home of the Tamil people, whose Tamil language—one of the longest surviving classical languages in the world—is widely spoken in the state and serves as its official language. The capital and largest city is Chennai.

Located in the southernmost part of the Indian peninsula, Tamil Nadu is bordered by the Indian union territory of Puducherry and states of Kerala, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh, as well as an international maritime border with Sri Lanka. Naturally, it is bound by the Western Ghats in the west, the Eastern Ghats in the north, the Bay of Bengal in the east, the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait to the south-east, and the Indian Ocean in the south.</p>
